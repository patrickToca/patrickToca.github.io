        <h1>The french constitution of 1793.</h1>

            <hr />

<p>Reading this text, it is extremely surprising to measure the thoughtfulness and care the authors of that time were dedicating to the <strong>common welfare</strong>.
Since then, we have known a long, slow and systematic regression.
We have much to <strong>re-learn</strong> from our forefathers and foremothers.</p>

<hr />

<h1>FRENCH CONSTITUTION of the twenty-fourth of June, 1793.</h1>

<pre><code>    of the republic.
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p>The French Republic is one and indivisible.</p>

<pre><code>of the division of the people.
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>The French people is, for the purpose of exercising its sovereignty, divided into primary assemblies according to cantons.</p></li>

<li><p>For the purpose of administration and justice, it is divided into departments, districts, and municipalities.</p>

<pre><code>of the right of citizenship.
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Every man born and living in France, of twenty-one years of age, and every alien, who has attained the age of twenty-one, and has been domiciled in France one year, and lives from his labor;
or has acquired property;
or has married a French woman;
or has adopted a child;
or supports an aged man;
and finally every alien whom the legislative body has declared as one well deserving of the human race, are admitted to exercise the rights of a French citizen.</p></li>

<li><p>The right of exercising the rights of citizen is lost:
by being naturalized in a foreign state;
by accepting offices of state, or favors which do not proceed from a democratic government;
by being sentenced to dishonorable or corporal punishments, till reinstated in the former state.</p></li>

<li><p>The exercise of the rights of citizen is suspended:
by being in a state of accusation;
by a sentence in contumaciam, so long as this sentence has not been rescinded.
of the sovereignty of the people.</p></li>

<li><p>The sovereign people embraces the whole of French citizens.</p></li>

<li><p>It chooses its deputies directly.</p></li>

<li><p>It delegates to electors the choice of administrators, public civil judges, penal judges, and judges of cassation.</p></li>

<li><p>It deliberates on laws.</p>

<pre><code>of the primary assemblies.
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>The primary assemblies are formed of the citizens who have resided six months in a canton.</p></li>

<li><p>They consist of no less than 200 and no more than 600 citizens, called together for the purpose of voting.</p></li>

<li><p>They are organized, after a president, secretaries and collectors of votes have been appointed.</p></li>

<li><p>They exercise their own police.</p></li>

<li><p>No one is allowed to appear there with arms.</p></li>

<li><p>The elections are made either by secret or loud voting, at the pleasure of each voter.</p></li>

<li><p>A primary meeting can in no case prescribe more than one manner of voting.</p></li>

<li><p>The collectors of votes note down the votes of those citizens who cannot write, and yet prefer to vote secretly.</p></li>

<li><p>The votes on laws are given by “Yes,” and “No.”</p></li>

<li><p>The elections of primary assemblies are published in the following manner:
The united citizens in the primary assembly at—, numbering—votes, vote for, or vote against, by a majority of—.</p>

<pre><code>of the national representation.
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Population is the only basis of national representation.</p></li>

<li><p>For every 40,000 individuals, one deputy is chosen.</p></li>

<li><p>Every primary assembly which is formed of from 39,000 to 41,000 individuals, chooses directly a deputy.</p></li>

<li><p>The choice is effected by an absolute majority of votes.</p></li>

<li><p>Every assembly makes an abstract of the votes, and sends a commissioner to the appointed central place of general record.</p></li>

<li><p>If at the first voting, no absolute majority be effected, a second meeting shall be held, and those two citizens who had the most votes, shall be voted for again.</p></li>

<li><p>In case of an equal division of votes, the oldest person has the preference, no matter whether he was voted for, or whether he was chosen without it. In case of an equality of age, the casting of lots shall decide.</p></li>

<li><p>Every Frenchman, who enjoys the rights of a citizen, is eligible throughout the whole republic.</p></li>

<li><p>Every deputy belongs to the whole nation.</p></li>

<li><p>In case of non-acceptance, of abdication, or expiration of office, or of the death of a deputy, the primary assembly which had chosen him shall choose a substitute.</p></li>

<li><p>A deputy who hands in his resignation, cannot leave his post till his successor shall have been appointed.</p></li>

<li><p>The French people assembles every year on the 1st of May for election.</p></li>

<li><p>It proceeds thereto, whatever the number of citizens [present] may be, who have a right to vote.</p></li>

<li><p>Extraordinary primary meetings are held at the demand of one-fifth of the eligible citizens.</p></li>

<li><p>The meeting is, in this case, called by the municipal authority of the usual place of assembly.</p></li>

<li><p>These extraordinary meetings can transact business only when at least more than one-half of the qualified voters are present.</p>

<pre><code>of the electoral assemblies.

<li><p>The deputies can, at no time, be held answerable, accused or condemned on account of opinions uttered within the legislative body.</p></li>
