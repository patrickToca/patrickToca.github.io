<h2><a name='1'>What elections are in France</a></h2>

<p>In France there are 3 main elections:</p>

<p>The <strong>presidential one</strong> organizes the election of the french President: this latter &ldquo;institution&rdquo; will garner more &lsquo;un-controlled&rsquo; power than the USA president. This election occurs every 5 years, it takes place in 2 rounds at the majority. The mechanisms promotes bi-partism.</p>

<p>The <strong>&ldquo;legislatives&rdquo; one</strong> (legislature) organizes the election of the Members of the Parliament&rsquo;s Assembly Nationale (lower house): this &ldquo;institution&rdquo; is meant to vote the laws. it takes place in 2 rounds at the majority. The parliament is composed of 577 members and is totally renewed every 5 years. This election is planned just after (one month) the Presidential one, in order to secure a legislature that is coherent with the president policy. Mono-partism is enforced.</p>

<p>The <strong>&ldquo;municipales&rdquo; one</strong> organizes the election of the municipal councils of France&rsquo;s communes. The first task of each newly constituted municipal council is to elect a mayor for that commune. This election occurs every 6 years and is a list based votation. The number of council members varies from 7 to 69 according to the size of the commune. The council members will elect the members of the Parliament&rsquo;s upper house: the french Senate (348 members).</p>

<p>These are institutions of a representative government and the powers respectively granted to each of them, defines what is called a Presidential system.</p>

<p>The present system has come out of the Coup d&rsquo;Etat of 13 May 1958, which has ended the 4th Republic (parliamentary system, that begun in 1946 just after the WWII) and started the 5th Republic in October 1958 (presidential system).</p>

<p>What is important to know for the moment, is that a larger and larger part of the french population is skeptical about these elections and its consequences. As a matter of fact, what characterizes most the recent history of french elections is the growing percentage of &ldquo;abstentionists&rdquo;, now and since at least 25 years the first actual &lsquo;party&rsquo; of any election.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s observe that this &lsquo;abstentionism&rsquo; is rarely properly analyzed.</p>

<h6>to be mentioned here</h6>

<hr />

<p>Since the events of 2005-2007 (I will briefly come back to it later) a first knowledge is gaining momentum in France: that the representative governments are not democracies, but aristocracies (a forgotten fact that was well known by Montesquieu, Rousseau or Sieyès in their time). This understanding has been refreshed by B.Manin (The Principles of Representative Government, 1997) who reminds us that while today representative institutions and democracy appear as virtually indistinguishable, when representative government was first established in Europe and America, it was designed in opposition to democracy proper.</p>

<hr />

<p>Is the legitimacy of these institutions challenged ?</p>

<h2><a name='2'>Recent experiences: awareness raising</a></h2>

<p>For the last 30 years (thirty !), abstentionism set a new record at each election (only the presidential has had a narrow escape from this terrible rule). During the 1983 &ldquo;municipales&rdquo;, 20,3% of registered voters had abstained; last march, 37,8% did.</p>

<p>If one add to these abstentionists all those who are not registered on voting lists (in France it is a requisite to go and register voluntarily. It is not automatic as in England. As a consequence about 7% of potential voters are not on the voting lists.), then abstentionism is getting close to 50% for European, Legislature and &ldquo;Municipales&rdquo; elections.</p>

<p>This situation is more striking in large cities, where voting are by far the minority: during the first round of 2014 &ldquo;municipales&rdquo;, in towns of more than 100.000 inhabitants, the official participation has been 53,8%, but if you add non registered people, a minority has actually voted.</p>

<p>This is all the more significant that according to Insee (Institut National de la statistique et des études économiques) the discriminants of &ldquo;voting/not voting&rdquo; are highly marked socially wise. As an example, youth are voting 2 times less than seniors: 41,2% of 18-24 years old are voting compare to 80.2% of 50-64 years old.</p>

<p>Complementary, the voting group is the one the least impacted by precarious jobs and social difficulties.</p>

<p>The voting minority is not representative of the population.</p>

<p>When one observes that in most cases previous elected MPs are rarely re-elected, and mainly because their voting fans have preferred to abstain (since no change actually occurred in spite of a so called alternating promised policy), a correlation should be validated between &ldquo;No-Change Alternating the MPs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Abstentionism&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Abstentionism is certainly the most important artefact of the French elections, yet almost no serious analysis exist about its signification.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s dare to think that abstentionism is an indicator of the raising awareness that the &lsquo;representative governement institutions&rsquo; are unable to deliver the population&rsquo;s expectations.</p>

<h6>to be recalled here</h6>

<hr />

<p>The 2005-2007 Coup d&rsquo;Etat.</p>

<p>The 2005 referendum was to decide whether or not the European Constitution should be accepted. After months of debates, numerous people&rsquo;s local assemblies and popular self-education, in spite of a massive propaganda for a YES by both UMP and PS with the media support (TV, newspapers and radios), the result had been NO. Abstentionism: was less than 16%, the lowest in recent votation history. The NO gathered more than 54%, a total legitimacy!</p>

<p><strong>Memorable argument</strong>: would you sign any contract that is 493 articles long, that not even lawyers are able to decipher and understand ?</p>

<p>Then, in 2007, following the recent election of N.Sarkozy (UMP), convened in a Congress (lower and upper houses together) the Members of Parliament (UMP + PS) garnered a majority of more than the 66% required by law to enforce a YES to a strict clone of the previous rejected European Constitution renamed Lisbon Treaty.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson learned</strong>: whatever people&rsquo;s vote will be, the &ldquo;pseudo&rdquo;-representants are ready to do the contrary! For the interest of who ?</p>

<hr />

<h2><a name='3'>April 2014 elections results: the true data</a></h2>

<p>In spite of a literally &ldquo;massive flood of information&rdquo; about the rise of Extreme Right and Right, the facts seem to contradict this communication outburst.</p>

<p>Based on the total number of registered voting persons, the &ldquo;raise of FN&rdquo; appears quite relative: In the 2012 elections, Ms Le Pen cornered 12%. In 2014, the FN has just gathered 8% during the 2014 &ldquo;municipales&rdquo; elections. Yet, it is true that the FN has progressed in terms of town conquered!</p>

<p>Same conclusion about the other traditional Right, UMP. Even though it has gained 62 towns of more than 10.000 inhabitants, one of its best success during the 5th Republic, it has in fact gathered less votations in 2014 than in 2008!</p>

<p>In fact, abstentionism has raised massively and the Socialist Party (the &lsquo;deceptive&rsquo; pseudo-Left or &lsquo;complexed&rsquo; new Right, according to certain french thinkers - Lordon, Badiou, Sapir) has seen a lot of its traditional voting fans refusing to support its neo-liberal actual policy.</p>

<p>The recent new movement (a gathering of 9 political parties: PCF, PG, Ensemble) named Front de Gauche (created in late 2008) has been the only one to slightly improve its position: 12% in 2014 compare to 11% in 2012. But this has hardly ever been mentioned in the media. An important situation is to be noted: during these elections, a part of the PCF direction has chosen, in some towns (50% of them in fact!), to abandon the FdG (that they contributed to found) and join  opportunistically the PS (as a direct consequence, the PCF has known one of its more memorable disaster and lost many of its long hold towns to the Right and the FdG credibility been put in question.)</p>

<h6>TODOS</h6>

<hr />

<p>The media have proven to play a political role more than an informative one during these elections.</p>

<p>In particular, the CSA () gave this information:</p>

<p>Relevés du temps d&rsquo;antenne au 24 février publié par le CSA. Voir sur le site du CSA, ici: <a href="http://www.csa.fr/Television/Le-suivi-des-programmes/Le-pluralisme-politique-et-les-campagnes-electorales/Elections-municipales-2014-temps-de-parole">http://www.csa.fr/Television/Le-suivi-des-programmes/Le-pluralisme-politique-et-les-campagnes-electorales/Elections-municipales-2014-temps-de-parole</a></p>

<p>En résumé : la situation se dégrade pour le Front de Gauche à la télé. 6% du temps pour le Front de Gauche alors qu&rsquo;on trouvait 7% au précédant relevé le 10 février dernier.</p>

<p>A la radio la situation frémit légèrement pour le Fdg : 6,6% du temps contre 5% au 10 février.</p>

<p>Mais le cumul PS/UMP/EELV est toujours très élevé 75%.</p>

<p>==========</p>

<p>Les temps de parole relevés par le Conseil Supérieur de l’Audiovisuel entre le 10 février et le 7 mars (période ou l’équité entre les candidats n’est pas imposée) montrent que le pluralisme est violé; que la démocratie est en danger; que le Front National est favorisé; que le Front de Gauche est censuré.</p>

<h2><a name='4'>An interpretation based on hidden facts</a></h2>

<p>We.</p>

<h2><a name='5'>A gambit to be confirmed by incoming European elections</a></h2>

<p>Alright, so we&rsquo;ve got our theory down pat, and it&rsquo;s time to start firing our massive s-expression-spewing assault rifles. First things first, we have to define our nodes:</p>

<pre><code>TODOS
</code></pre>

<p>For those of you unfamiliar with pylisp, this will define a class with fields <code>p</code>, <code>key</code>, and so on, and provide a basic constructor for this class.</p>

<h3><a name='6'>The collapse of old parties confirmed</a></h3>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s get cracking. First up is lookup, that is, the <code>get</code> function. Simple enough. Since our treap is already a binary tree, we can use the standard binary tree lookup algorithm, completely ignoring priorities:</p>

<pre><code>TODOS
</code></pre>

<p>Simple enough, eh? What about containment? Oh, it&rsquo;s even easier:</p>

<h3><a name='7'>The dissident movement is structuring itself</a></h3>

<h3><a name='8'>A common understanding becoming clearer</a></h3>
