my blog in 2013
--------

Just started because of an article by Noam Chomsky in March 2013, read recently (see ref. in the blog /about).


Implemented and generated with the 2012 Alexander Demin (thanks to have shared it) "goblog" package.

After slight adaptations, goblog is the exact tool I needed:

1- written in Go,  
2- simple structure, straightforward and fast (generation in less than 1 sec for many docs),  
3- a search facility is available (simple reverse index on Title and Content -- can be changed by the Go "ferret" package by Mark Canning),  
4- RSS/atom facility is available,  
5- bilingual support (fran√ßais and english for me),  
6- tags, categories supported (draft docs. are not processed),  
7- rendering based on layouts/templates,  
8- Markdown input based (using "blackfriday" parser go package by Russ Ross),  
9- Easy to evolve to a more sophisticated web/docs generator,  
10- And It's been my first acquaintance with Go (Nov. 2012)!  

The content of the blog will be mainly focused on programming and politics (the noble part, if can be). 'Cause I am upset by what's going on around me, but I still enjoy programming (...a noble craft?).
